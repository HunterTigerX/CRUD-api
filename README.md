- If your age type was a string, but it was an implicit number, I decided to convert it to a number. In any other cases, if it't not a number or not an implicit number, error would occur. 

- Since it's not specified, age is allowed to be negative. Wanted to make a check, but thought that reviewer1 can consider it as a mistake since negative numbers are still numbers.
